StayBnB is a clone of Airbnb, designed to let users browse, book, and list rental properties. It provides a user-friendly interface where travelers can search for short-term stays, and hosts can add their properties with details like price, location, and amenities. The project focuses on replicating Airbnbâ€™s core functionalities, such as property listings, booking management, and user authentication. StayBnB is built as a learning project to understand web development concepts and improve coding skills.
